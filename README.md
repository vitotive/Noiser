<h2>
  About the Project
  </h2>

<p> 
  Hi, my name is Victor and I'm a programmming student and hobbyist designer. Recently I started to do skins to Rainmeter, a program to customise operational systems based in scripts in Lua Language. Noiser is my first try to make a funcional skin of a block note. I surely want to add many more functionalitys to Noiser but I still a newbie in Lua so I need a little bit more research and learning. If you wanna collaborate fell free to use this repository or send me some tips, any help is appreciated.

<h2>
  Explaining folders and files
  </h2>

<p>
  There are two folders on Noiser files: "interface design" and "minimal". In "interface design" there's a ".fig" file were I do all the design part of Noiser. In "minimal" you will see some design elements in ".png", the ".notes" files where your notes will be stored, and the skin main codes in ".ini" files.

<h2>
  How do I run this?
  </h2>

<p>
  After downloading and installing <a href="link" target="_blank">Rainmeter</a>, open the Noiser installer and click "Install".
