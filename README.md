<h2> About the Project </h2>
<p> 
Hi, my name is Victor and I'm a programmming student and hobbyist designer. <br>
Very recently I started to do skins to Rainmeter, a program to customise operational
systems based in scripts in Lua Language. <br>
Noiser is my first try to make a funcional skin of a block note, based in others public skin scripts. <br>
I surely want to add many more functionalitys to Noiser but I still a newbie in Lua so I need a little
bit more researsh and learning. <br>
If you wanna collaborate fell free to use this repository or send me some tips, any help is appreciated. <br>
