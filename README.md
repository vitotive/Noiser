# Noiser
Noiser is a Rainmeter skin.

Hi, my name is Victor and I'm a programmming student and hobbyist designer.
Very recently I started to do skins to Rainmeter, a program to customise operational systems based in scripts in Lua Language.
Noiser is my first try to make a funcional skin of a block note, based in others public skin scripts.
I surely want to add many more functionalitys to Noiser but I still a newbie in Lua so I need a little bit more researsh and learning.
If you wanna collaborate fell free to use this repository or send me some tips, any help is appreciated.
